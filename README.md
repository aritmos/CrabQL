## ðŸš§ CAUTION

- This project is still in very very early stages of production, I am still figuring out how to
best design the core functionality of the project.
- Take a look at the [`wiki`](https://github.com/aritmos/rs2sql/wiki) some examples of the potential
uses of `rs2sql`.
- Upon further development, eventually I plan to publish the crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io).

## âœ¨ Focus and Goals

`rs->sql`(or `rs2sql`) is an ambitious project to "rustify the SQL language", stemming from a
thought of how database querying would have been implemented by the "Rust team". 
This project by no means attempts to be a complete reimagining of the SQL language;
it simply tries to port the SQL syntax into a natural and friendly functional Rust code.

The core of the library is a query builder that can output `String`s of SQL.
As an experimental draft I have something like this in mind:

```rust
let query = {
    let checker: ExprChecker::from_schema("schema.sql").unwrap();
    let reader: Reader = Reader::new(&mut checker);

    let monthly_cost: SQLQuery = {
        let monthly_cost: SealedReader = reader
            .table("marketing")
            .new_col("category", |t| { 
                case!{                
                    t["created_date"].lt(Date::new("2020-04-01")) => "pre-pandemic",
                    t["created_date"].lt(Date::new("2024-01-01")) => "last year",
                    _ => "recent",
                } 
            }) 
            .filter(|t| t["category"].neq("old") & t["completed"].eq(true))
            .select_as("cost_by_month", |t| {
                let month = t["created_date"].to_char("YYYY-MM"); 
                [ t["campaign_id"].as("campaign"), month, t["cost"].sum().as("monthly_cost") ]
            }).unwrap(); 

        
        monthly_cost
            .unseal(&mut checker)
            .group_by("campaign") 
            .order_by("campaign")
            .select(|v| {
                [v["campaign"], v["monthly_cost"].avg().as("avg cost")]
            })
            .unwrap()
            .to_sql()
    }
});

println!("{}", query);
```
outputs

```sql
WITH cost_by_month AS (
    SELECT
        campaign_id                      AS campaign,
        TO_CHAR(created_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS created_date,
        SUM(cost)                        AS total_cost
    FROM (
        SELECT *,
            CASE
                WHEN created_date < DATE '2020-04-01' THEN 'pre-pandemic'
                WHEN created_date < DATE '2024-01-01' THEN 'last year'
                ELSE 'recent' END AS category
        FROM marketing
    ) x
    WHERE category != 'pre-pandemic' AND completed = TRUE
)

SELECT campaign, AVG(total_cost) AS 'avg cost'
FROM cost_by_month
GROUP BY campaign
ORDER BY campaign
```

### ðŸŒ¿ Natural

One of the core values of `rs2sql` is that of it providing _natural_ Rust code. 
In particular this means **no string expression parsing**.
Other crates providing a Rust to SQL translation often use an API like:

```rust
selection.where("version > 12").select("'v' + str(version) + '_x86_64-linux'")
```

With internal logic parsing the expression encoded into the string. I don't like this and I don't want it. 
Instead `rs2sql` makes use of Rust's associated type parameters allowing the "overloading" of common
operations to return new types which encode the action. These are then packaged inside of closures 
providing access into the query builder's state. Sadly the only case where this pattern cannot be 
implemented is ordering and equality, which require the use of methods:

```rust
selection.where(|t| t["version"].gt(12)).select(|t| "v" + t["version"] + "_x86_64-linux")
```

The ability to write your query's expressions as normal rust code means complex queries remain easy
to write and read. Imagine writing the following `WHERE` clause within the string-parsing Rust-to-SQL crates:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE (salary > 100_000 OR department = 'Engineering')
  AND (start_date >= '2023-01-01' AND start_date < '2024-01-01')
  AND (age BETWEEN 25 AND 35 AND status = 'Active')
  AND (city IN ('New York', 'San Francisco', 'Seattle') OR manager_id IS NOT NULL)
  AND (NOT (position = 'Manager' AND (department = 'HR' OR department = 'Finance')))
  AND (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM performance_reviews WHERE employee_id = employees.id AND rating > 4))
  AND (NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM disciplinary_actions WHERE employee_id = employees.id))
```

... at that point you might as well write the entire query into a string. 
Users can alternatively break up the filter into subqueries, 
which can work as long as the logic is decoupled but does fragment the flow of the query's creation.

On the other hand with `rs2sql` we can write the whole thing within a single block, 
making use of variables, comments, and logic-segmentation as we please:

```rust
reader.table("employees").filter(|t| {
    let high_salary = 100_000;
    let high_salary_engineers = t["salary"].gt(high_salary) & t["department"].eq("Engineering"); 
    let active_and_young = t["age"].between(25, 35) & t["status"].eq("Active");
    let big_office = t["city"].in(external_api.get_main_offices)
    let is_manager = t["manager_id"].is_null();
    ...

    high_salary_engineers & ... & (big_office | !is_manager) & ...
})
```

### ðŸš‘ Safe

#### Type Safety 
One of the benefits of foregoing string-parsing is gaining the type-safety that rust can provide. The user doesn't have to double check that there are no missing quotation marks or brackets in a complex statement.

#### State Safety
The other core safety-related feature, is that `rs2sql` **guarantees query correctness at the query's build time**. This is done by feeding the query builder the databases schema. As the query is built, every statement gets checked for correctness: does this table exist? is this column numeric? etc. Users may opt out of using a pre-fetched database schema (internally called a `CompiledSchema`) and instead use a `DerivedSchema`.

A `DerivedSchema` starts as a blank slate, and doesn't require any information about the database. As queries are created using this object, it keeps track of the accesses that are made, the operations on columns, etc. The `DerivedSchema` guarantees that any queries are simply self-consistent (this is also done implicitly with a `CompiledSchema`). So if one query uses `employees.id` as a string, another can't be using it as an integer.

```rust
let mut checker = DerivedChecker::new(); // schema is built along with the operations that use it
// all of the following accesses are added into the schema. any clashes would result in an error

// The checker infers that the _likes_ column is numeric.
let view1 = Reader::new(&mut checker)
    .table("post_likes")
    .select(|t| [t["post_id"], t["likes"] + 1]) 
    .unwrap();

// Checker throws an error because _likes_ column is numeric but string concatenation requires a string.
// The error is stored in the reader's state, which will fail to seal.
let view2 = Reader::new(&mut checker)
    .table("post_likes")
    .select(|v| [v["post_id"], v["likes"] + "text"]) 
```

#### Ordering Safety

Both the `CompiledSchema` and `DerivedSchema` update themselves to include any internal views or table modifications that the user defines. Self-consistency is a great feature to have in long read-write operations where the database's internal state is bound to change. `rs2sql` aims to implement a locking mechanism to ensure that any cases that depend on a specific query-ordering can only procude SQL queries that guarantee this ordering. 

For example a user might create a query that defines a new column within a table, and a subsequent query might write values into that new column. The aim is to ensure that these two queries can only be finaly parsed into an SQL `String` together, in their necessary order. If this werent the case, and the user could separately create the queries, there is no guarantee that they will be called within the database in the right order!

```rust
// TODO: API is still too-underdeveloped to showcase how the locking mechanism works
//       In particular how queries should be grouped before creating the complete SQL.
//       (Imagine the implementation yourself if you want)
```

## ðŸ¤¨ Why??

All of this talk about types, and state checking, manipulation and safety seems like quite a lot of complexity for what tends to be a generally straightforward task. Is it really worth it? Yes ... maybe ... who knows.

I assume that the large majority of projects that manipulate databases through an application boundary keep their queries nice and small. In many cases it might simply suffice to use string interpolation to write the SQL query if one wants to use variables or logic.

However when thinking about all of the possible implementations of a Rust-to-SQL library this version with extensive use of Rust features in the style of Rust's safety guarantees quickly became my favourite. This kind of a transpiler is vastly interesting to simply think about how to structure the internal representations and logic, and its complexity is something I'm hoping to push me into learning more and writing better Rust.
